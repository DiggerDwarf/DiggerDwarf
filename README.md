# Hello haiiii how are you :)))

I'm a computer science student.

I mostly code in C++ but i also do in python.

I'm trying to do most of the stuff myself to learn stuff (except handling the Win32 API. Seriously wtf.)\
<br>
### Current focus : 
I'm coding a file format converter, and altough it may be small right now i'm gonna try and add support for as many formats as i can ! (As long as they're not too hard)
You can check that out in my `converter` repository (yeah i really didn't search very long for the name)


### Other projects :
Also I coded my own little 3D render engine in C++, and i'm kind of proud of it !!\
You can check it out in my `Model-Rendering` repository ! *Or not... if you despise me that much...*

Another little project i'm proud of is a little falling sand engine !\
The funny thing is that i coded that during a long car ride when i was bored hehe\
I've still got no fancy naming skills, that's in my `sand` repository.
