# Hello haiiii how are you :)))

I'm a computer science student.\
I mostly code in C++ but i also do in python.
<br><br>
### Current focus: 
I'm coding my own little 3D render engine in C++!!\
I'm trying to do most of the stuff myself to learn stuff (except handling the Win32 API. Seriously wtf.)\
You can check it out in my `stuff` repository, in the `obj_render` folder ! *Or not... if you despise me that much...*
