# Hello haiiii how are you :)))

I'm a computer science student.

I mostly code in C++ but i also do in python.

I'm trying to do most of the stuff myself to learn stuff (except handling the Win32 API. Seriously wtf.)\
<i>Edit: I took my chances. I am trying the Win32 API.<br>
If you do not see me again, you know why...</i>

### Current focus : 
I'm currently learning the Win32 and OpenGL APIs and putting it into practice to make my own <a href="https://github.com/DiggerDwarf/window">windowing + rendering library</a> with (hopefully) 0 dependencies.\
So far i've only used GLEW to load OpenGL functions, but that can be removed later without too much trouble (or at least I hope so...)

### Other projects :
Alright so my previous focus was coding a particle simulation for fluid dynamics (sounds fancy but really i don't know what i'm doing)\
So umm all of that is in <a href=https://github.com/DiggerDwarf/particles>`particles`</a>

Also I coded my own little 3D render engine in C++, and i'm kind of proud of it !!\
You can check it out in my <a href=https://github.com/DiggerDwarf/Model-Rendering>`Model-Rendering`</a> repository ! *Or not... if you despise me that much...*

Another little project i'm proud of is a little falling sand engine !\
The funny thing is that i coded that during a long car ride when i was bored hehe\
I've still got no fancy naming skills, that's in my <a href=https://github.com/DiggerDwarf/sand>`sand`</a> repository.
